There are 3 files in this database, all containing 8-ply positions
    
    win-pos.db
    Contains all positions that are a win for red
    
    draw-pos.db
    Contains all positions that are a draw
    
    loss-pos.db
    Contains all positions that are a loss for red
    
The positions are stored as 64-bit integers.
Each 64-bit integer represents one position.
Only the first 49 bits of the integer are used to describe the position.
A position is described by 49 bits as follows.
The bits describe the following squares on the board:
.  .  .  .  .  .  .
5 12 19 26 33 40 47   Top of the board (sixth row)
4 11 18 25 32 39 46
3 10 17 24 31 38 45
2  9 16 23 30 37 44
1  8 15 22 29 36 43
0  7 14 21 28 35 42   Bottom of the board (first row)

The dots on the place of bit 6, 13, 20, 27, 34, 41 and 48 have a special meaning (they're called top-bits).
They tell us which color true bits represent in that column.
If the top-bit is true all true bits in that column represent red pieces, otherwise the represent yellow bits.
The highest filled square in a column is always a true bit.
The false bits below this square represent the other color.
The false bits above the highest true bit are empty squares.

If a column is empty the value of the top-bit is meaningless.
The top-bit should then always be false in order to make sure a position always has the same value.
All remaining bits (bit 49 and higher) are false.

Almost every position has a symmetric twin that has the same game theoretical value.
To save space only one of the twins is saved.
This is always the twin that simply has the lowest value (the positions are after all simply 64-bit integers).
